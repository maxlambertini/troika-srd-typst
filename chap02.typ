== Overview:

+ Roll 1d3+3 to determine Skill.
+ Roll 2d6+12 to determine Stamina.
+ Roll 1d6+6 to determine Luck.
+ Record Baseline Possessions that every new character starts with:
+ 2d6 Silver Pence, a Knife, a Lantern & Flask of Oil, a Rucksack, 6
  Provisions.
+ Roll d66 on the Background Table and record Possessions and Skills.

== Backgrounds
<backgrounds>
Backgrounds are everything your character was before you got hold of
them. They provide you with Skills, Possessions, and other Special
benefits where noted. Slide into the role and make it your own.

Roll randomly to determine your starting Background. Notice that they
only touch the edge of specificity: it is up to you to tailor them to
the worlds you play in. Rework them or remove them entirely and replace
them with your own unique vision of the spheres. Boldly lay claim to the
games you play, create content recklessly, and always write in pen.

=== Creating Your Own Backgrounds
<creating-your-own-backgrounds>
When creating your own Backgrounds, as a general rule, stick to 10 or so
total points distributed in a range of 1 to 3 with 3 being someone who
has already mastered their trade. Do not dismiss the importance of a
description — they are the players’ window into the world — but don’t
feel intimidated by them. Keep them simple and pack as much information
into them as you are able; when they are short and evocative the player
will fill in the gaps. The Backgrounds need not be balanced or equal to
one another but should instead be fun and flavourful. After making a new
Background take a moment to consider the reaction of someone receiving
it instead of some other entry in your particular and ever changing
list. Balance the enjoyment rather than the numbers.

== Sample Backgrounds
<sample-backgrounds>
=== 11 Ardent Giant of Corda
<ardent-giant-of-corda>
Every giant has a different story about Corda, well told and interrupted
with tears and laughter, of how they lost it and mean to find it soon
enough but oh, what of today? We should drink and cheer, we’ll search
once again in the morning!

==== Possessions
<possessions>
- An Artefact of Lost Corda, being either an enormous Blue Star Map
  which can tell you where any portal leads \(with a successful
  Astrology test) or a pocket barometer for forecasting the weather \(5
  in 6 accuracy) or a Ruby Lorgnette granting +2 Second Sight.

==== Advanced Skills
<advanced-skills>
- 4 Strength
- 3 Astrology
- 2 Run
- 2 Climb

=== 12 Befouler of Ponds
<befouler-of-ponds>
You’re a wise man, a high priest, a pond-pisser, a typical but committed
adherent of P!P!Ssshrp. The bloated Toad God has no church other than
the periphery of ponds where the foulness catches in the reeds and no
congregation other than the gnats and dragonflies. You minister to them
all the same.

==== Possessions
<possessions-1>
- Sackcloth Robes, caked in stinking mud and undergrowth. +1 to Sneak
  rolls in marshy terrain while wearing them, -1 everywhere else ’cos it
  stinks!

==== Special
<special>
You never contract disease as a result of drinking stagnant liquids.

=== 13 Burglar
<burglar>
As a second-story man you often have cause to wander. Enemies come
naturally from both sides of the law and it pays to keep ahead of
trouble.

==== Possessions

- Roll of Lock Picks.
- Grappling Hook.

==== Advanced Skills
<advanced-skills-2>

<special-1>
You may Test your Luck to find and get in with the local criminal
underbelly if one exists.

=== 14 Cacogen
<cacogen>
You are Those-Filthy-Born, spawned in the hump-backed sky lit only by
great black anti-suns and false light. Your mother was sailing on the
golden barges or caught in some more abstract fate when she passed you,
far from the protective malaise of the million spheres. You were
receptive to the power and the glory at a generative time and it shows
in your teratoid form.

==== Possessions
<possessions-3>
- Fusil.
- 2d6 Plasmic Cores.
- Sword.
- Velare.

=== 15 Chaos Champion
<chaos-champion>
You no longer don the spiked brass armour but you still have the ear of
your Chaos patron. They’re happy for you to experiment with not plunging
your world into disorder and, ultimately, darkness, but the door is
always open.

==== Possessions

<special-2>
Name your patron. You may call upon your patron for aid once per day. To
do so roll three 6s on 3d6. The GM interprets their intervention.

=== 16 Claviger
<claviger>
The Key Masters wander the universe fathoming the workings of all
entryways. Though they’re quite fascinated with simple chests and doors
they are most excited by metaphysical and metaphorical barriers. You
might find small conclaves of Clavigers camped around the feet of Demon
Gates, debating appropriate methods of attack, or building obscure
machines of entry.

==== Possessions
<possessions-5>
- Festooned with Keys \(counts as Modest Armour).
- A Distinguished Sledgehammer \(Damage as Maul).
- Lock Picking Tools.

==== Advanced Skills
<advanced-skills-5>

=== 21 Demon Stalker
<demon-stalker>
You stake your reputation upon your ability to hunt and kill demonic
creatures and those who break bread with them. Goat men in the wilds or
the Angel cults of the slums, all need to be driven back off the edge of
the map and onto the shores of chaos.

==== Possessions
<possessions-6>
- A Silver Sword.
- 16 Silver Arrows and Bow.
- Pouch of Salt.
- Vial of Demon Blood.

- 2 Bow Fighting
- 1 Tracking
- 1 Sneak

=== 22 Dwarf
<dwarf>
You are a short, hairy, belligerent, alcohol dependent creature. Dwarfs
are a sculpted people, ungendered, and thus there are no Dwarf children
or Dwarf families to prevent you from fully committing to the important
Dwarfy endeavours of creating fine art in unusual places. You intend to
find the most unusual places in all the million spheres.

==== Possessions
<possessions-7>
- Masonry Hammer.

==== Special
<special-3>
Dwarfs may eat gems and rare metals as food replacements. You, in fact,
vastly prefer the taste of rare minerals to mundane food.

=== 23 Epopt
<epopt>
You are a roaming seer, selling your visions at courts and fetes. You
are instantly recognisable by your yellow coif and habit as being open
for business. Road weary and worldwise, your unpopular visions cause you
to constantly move on.

==== Possessions
<possessions-8>
- Yellow Epopt Outfit, padded for protection against unhappy clients
  \(counts as Modest Armour).

==== Special
<special-4>
Epopts may Test their Luck to get a yes or no answer to a question about
mundane matters. The GM should make this Test in private, not informing
the Epopt if their visions are accurate.

=== 24 Exographer
<exographer>
Where you come from it’s become quite normal to traverse the Spheres.
Idle academics like yourself have even begun to study these more remote
reaches of the divine effluvia. Though these rural indwellers may never
appreciate your important work, you continually, thanklessly measure
their latent phlogiston.

For posterity.

==== Possessions
<possessions-9>
- Hermetically Sealed Rubber Suit \(counts as Heavy Armour)
- Exographical Surveyors Box

=== 25 The Fellowship of Knidos
<the-fellowship-of-knidos>
Mathmologists honour the clean and unambiguous truths of mathematics and
coordinate them with their observations of the multiverse. All things
can be measured and predicted with the application of the correct
mathmological ratios, those methods applied to penetrate the ethereal
surface and glimpse the fundamental numbers below.

=== 26 Fellow of the Peerage of Porters & Basin Fillers
<fellow-of-the-peerage-of-porters-basin-fillers>
Luggers are a servile group by nature, most often found in the service
of others, weighed down by loads that would buckle a donkey. You take
pride in this, so much so that the everyday assignments of the guild
cannot sate your desire to serve, causing you to venture out in search
of a real challenge for such a talented varlet.

==== Possessions
<possessions-11>
- A Wooden Yoke.
- Brown Overcoat and Soft Doffing Cap of the Guild.

No matter what country, sphere, or abstract dimension you may find
yourself in, be assured that gremlins will be there digging their
warrens and bothering nice people willing to pay you a shiny penny to
bash their little heads in.

==== Possessions
<possessions-12>
- Small but Vicious Dog.
- Flat Cap.

==== 32 Journeyman of the Guild of Sharp Corners
<journeyman-of-the-guild-of-sharp-corners>
You are an assassin in training, graduated from fighting dummies and
branding practise clients, freshly imbued with a license to ply your
trade. You haven’t fully developed the idiosyncratic methods required of
a master but you are on the path.

sword.

==== Possessions
<possessions-14>
- Exquisite Pistolet.
- Bandolier containing 18 Plasmic Cores.
- Greatsword.

  Autarch’s divine alchemy and considered Modest Armour while weighing
  the same as normal clothing \(takes no slots in your inventory).

<advanced-skills-14>
- 2 Greatsword Fighting
- 2 Pistolet Fighting
- 1 Run
- 1 Fist Fighting
- 1 Astrology

=== 34 Lonesome Monarch
<lonesome-monarch>
You were the ruler of all you surveyed, a great conqueror, a lawbringer!
Unfortunately your horse sped off into the pixie forest, or the court
magician ensured you disappeared, or you led a sortie into the stars to
put your stamp on them as well. Either way you are now a lost and lonely
sovereign without a kingdom — no one has heard of you or your people.
Most don’t believe you and laugh, or worse, they do believe you and
shrug at the vagaries of fate.

==== Possessions
<possessions-15>
- Nice Weapon of your choice.
- Crown.
- Tired Horse.

==== Advanced Skills

=== 35 Member of Miss Kinsey’s Dining Club
<member-of-miss-kinseys-dining-club>
The Eaters know that there are only two worlds: the Without and the
Within. They intend to insert as much of the prior into the latter as
they can while experiencing the finest delights available. All culinary
experience is open to them as nothing is forbidden at Miss Kinsey’s. Try
the other, other, other white meat.

==== Possessions
<possessions-16>

  \(Damage as Knife. On a Mighty Blow you may cleanly strip all the

<advanced-skills-16>
- 3 Etiquette
- 1 Strength
- 1 Tracking
- 1 Trapping
- 1 Gastrology

==== Special
<special-5>
Eaters are immune to mundane ingested poisons. They may also identify
any object if eaten, gaining knowledge of its material, its origin \(if
plausibly familiar), and its magical properties on a successful Test of
Gastrology though the object must be thoroughly masticated, not merely
swallowed and passed. This does not grant special immunity to any
effects the object may possess.

=== 36 Monkeymonger
<monkeymonger>
Life on The Wall is hard. One is never more than a few yards from an
endless fall yet those precarious villages still need to eat. This is
where you come in with your Edible Monkeys \(the distinction is purely
for appeal since all monkeys are of course edible). You used to spend
days on end dangling your feet off the edge of the world, watching over
your chittering livestock while they scampered hither and thither, but
there was no future in monkey meat. You wanted much more and so stepped
off. Or you fell off. Either way you and some unlucky monkeys are here
now and that’s all that matters.

==== Possessions
<possessions-17>
- Monkey Club.
- Butcher’s Knife.

- 5 Austere
- 6 Aggressive

=== 41 Necromancer
<necromancer>
The least popular of magical practitioners, Necromancers are shunned by
the major centres of learning, left to their own devices on the edges of
society, passing on knowledge in the time honoured master–student
dynamic. This loneliness encourages students to make their own friends.

==== Possessions
<possessions-18>
- Dusty Robes.
- The Skull of your Master or Zombie Servant or Ghost with whom you have
  developed a codependent relationship.

==== Advanced Skills
<advanced-skills-18>

=== 42 Parchment Witch
<parchment-witch>
Known for their smooth skin, midnight gatherings, and preternatural fear
of rain and open flames; the Parchment Witches are long-dead sorcerers
who cannot give up the vanity of life. They cover themselves in perfect
paper skin, a patiently painted and immaculately folded imitation of
life intended to hide ancient bone and gristle.

==== Special
<special-7>
You are undead and so do not need to breathe or circulate blood. You
take double Damage from Silver Weapons and regain Stamina half as
effectively from all sources. You must Test your Luck if outside in the
rain, are made wet, are close to open flames, or suffer generally
grievous wounds. A failure will see your skin ruined. If your skin is
compromised you are very obviously a walking corpse.

=== 43 Derivative Dwarf
<derivative-dwarf>
Dwarfs are known for being the finest artisans of the million spheres.
Give a Dwarf a rock and they will make gold, give a Dwarf a boulder and
they will make a Dwarf. You were supposed to be the finest expression of
Dwarfy craftsmanship, a true masterpiece, a brand new step in aesthetic
design, a jump not seen since the old masters.

<special-8>
As 22 Dwarf but additionally:

To non-Dwarfy eyes you look like any other Dwarf. Only Dwarfs can see
the derivative or uninspired parts of your creation. Other Dwarfs will
completely ignore you since you remind them of their fading novelty. You
have +4 Sneak versus Dwarfs.

=== 44 Questing Knight
<questing-knight>
You are on a quest for the grail, or the sword, or the throne, or for
god, or a lost love, or some other significant object. Your sort are
common enough, wandering the worlds, acting out your romantic melodrama,
accusing good folk of being demons or faeries. Questing Knights are
generally considered to be harmless.

==== Possessions

With the body of a bull, the head of a man, the forelegs of a cat, and
the wings of a swan you are the sweetest of the children of the gods.
You, however, were not content to rest on your cloud and instead
descended from the heavens or crawled up from the abyss and set about
finding your own path among the stars.

As an integral part of your tutelage in the sub-dimensional academy of
the Cordial Wizard God you spent your childhood learning about the fate
of pixies, the colour of magic, ritual grammar, and endless other
theoretical topics. Now you’re out in the world, discovering that your
education hardly accounted for any of the things that you’ve seen.

==== Possessions

=== 54 Fellow of The Sublime Society of Beef Steaks
<fellow-of-the-sublime-society-of-beef-steaks>
Brawlers believe the application of might and a good beef steak is the
universal truth. Words have no power and can no more define the universe
than they can build a house, lift a cup, or sear a steak. Might can!
Really, they have thought a lot about this.

The blessing of Telak awards you Armour equal to half \(rounded down)

would be 3 while if you carried 9 it would be 4. You must be overtly
armed at all times or else Telak will take this blessing away until you
forge and donate to the unarmed a brand new Sword.

pouches of unguents, holy icons and herbs. No matter the metaphysical
need, you are always prepared.

<thinking-engine>

==== Special
<special-11>
You don’t recover Stamina by resting in the usual manner — instead you
must spend a full rest period with a hot iron welding your skin back
together like putty. For each hour of rest with access to the right
tools you regain 3 Stamina.

You may recharge plasmic machines by hooking your fluids to them and
spending Stamina at a rate of 1 Stamina and 6 minutes per charge.

You always count as being at least Lightly Armoured.

=== 62 Vengeful Child
<vengeful-child>
Your village was burnt down by ruffians, or your mother was beheaded by
snake cultists, or your father was hung by corrupt officials. Either way
you took umbrage and entered the world with a chip on one shoulder and
an oversized Sword on the other.

==== Possessions

=== 65 Yongardy Lawyer
<yongardy-lawyer>
Down in Yongardy they do things differently. They respect the Law. Every
day there is a queue outside the courts to get a seat to see the latest
up and coming barrister defend their case with a metre of steel. The
people follow the careers of their favourite solicitors, watch all their
cases, collect their portraits, and sneak into the court after hours to
dab the patches of blood on white handkerchiefs. In Yongardy, they love
the Law.

today.
