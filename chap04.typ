<items>
If an item is not listed here assume it adds a bonus of +1 to rolls
associated with it. Lockpicks, for instance, would add +1 to Lock rolls
while a rope would add +1 to Climb, and so on.

Item bonuses only apply if you are trained in the Skill they are meant
to enhance. Lockpicks will only give their bonus if you know how to use
lockpicks \(have 1+ in Locks already).

An incomplete list of desirous things:

#strong[Astrological Equipment] requires twenty minutes to set up and
use but doesn’t need to be outside. Consists of a ruby specular, charms
against reciprocal observation, and complicated charts of the spheres.
Grants +1 to Astrology.

#strong[A bale hook] counts as a Knife for Damage and grants +1 on rolls
to lift heavy objects.

#strong[The blue star maps of Corda] hold the secrets of travel between
the spheres. Every juncture in space and time can be found on its many
square metred face if one is sufficiently educated in its use. Test
Astrology to tell the precise destination of any portal.

#strong[An Epopt’s Staff] is a tool, an advert, and, in a pinch, a
Weapon. In its head is set a cloudy ruby, like a useless magnifying
glass, which grants the user +1 Second Sight while peering through it.

#strong[A fusil] is a long Weapon that looks like a rifle and can be
used in melee as a Club. A Fusil holds 6 charges before the plasmic core
needs replacing.

#strong[Knuckle dice] are made from the nimble, petal shaped knuckle
bones of goblins and make excellent two sided dice.

#strong[A pistolet] is a hand held energy Weapon. Holds enough energy
for 8 shots.

#strong[Plasmic cores] are crystalised starlight cast in metal. Or
astral vapours captured in glass. Or maybe hard-ghosts? Whatever it is,
it’s pretty and used as a fuel source for exotic Weapons and reckless
magicians. A plasmic core can be cracked open and huffed by a wizard in
place of spending Stamina on a Spell. However, if an Oops! Table roll is
called for the wizard has overdosed and drops dead, foaming at the
mouth.

#strong[The pocket barometer] is part of a fashionable affectation for
the metropolitan Troikan. Though the city has no discernable weather it
is considered polite to check it intermittently and comment on the
present clemency and hope for it to continue into the future. Examining
its quartz face will inform you of future weather with 5 in 6 accuracy.

#strong[Pocket gods] are little cloth puppets made in the image of your
numerous gods. If you whisper a secret to one and throw it away you
regain 1 Luck.

#strong[Ruby lorgnettes] are collapsable spectacles made with ruby
lenses that require a free hand to use. While wearing them your sight is
impaired but you can see sorcerous activity clearly \(+2 Second Sight).

#strong[Salt] is the poor man’s Silver. Where Silver kills the demonic
and the dead Salt merely harms or bars.

#strong[Silver] is the star metal, the most untouched material fallen
from the hump-backed sky. Weapons made from it may inflict Damage to
creatures normally immune to material harm.

#strong[A tea set] grants +1 to Etiquette when you have the time to sit
down and make tea for those you are trying to impress.

#strong[The Velare], when inactive, looks like an ornate piece of
costume jewellery, usually a brooch or a circlet. When active it
produces a full body disguise on the wearer formed from hard-light.
Grants +4 Disguise. Lasts for 24 hours before needing to be recharged
with a plasmic core.

#strong[Witch-hair ropes] are immune to manipulation via magical means.

#strong[A yoke] gives you +4 carry capacity while worn but you can’t use
your hands while wearing it.

== Spells
<spells>
To cast a Spell you must spend Stamina equal to the casting cost \(the
number in brackets) and Roll Under your Skill Total in the Spell you
wish to cast. A double 1 will always succeed while a double 6 will
always fail and require a roll on the Oops! Table.

=== Affix \(3)
<affix-3>
Cause a subject to be fixed in place. While they are so held they do not
move, breathe, fall, perspire, acquire, or otherwise change. They are
totally immune to harm, in fact. Lasts for 3 minutes.

=== Amity \(4)
<amity-4>
The College of Friends always sends out its Factotums on nights after
Amity classes. Clearing out the bars and brothels of their drunken
apprentices is tiring work. Use of this Spell causes the target to Test
their Luck \(or Skill for Enemies) or become very friendly towards the
wizard, as though they were an old friend. They will not act
irrationally, though, and if they were already a bit of a boor this
might not change much.

=== Animate \(2)
<animate-2>
Cause inanimate objects to question their place. One object up to the
size of a human baby may be caused to hop around and do whatever else
the wizard wishes.

=== Assassin’s Dagger \(3)
<assassins-dagger-3>
Evocatively named but actually quite mundane. The wizard whispers to an
object and that object then seeks out and vigorously and repeatedly
bumps into the desired target. Obviously if you whisper to a poisoned
dagger the result is one thing while doing it to a letter is another.
Travels any distance and always arrives \(eventually).

=== Assume Shape \(4)
<assume-shape-4>
The wizard undergoes a distressing transformation into an inanimate
object no larger than a piano and no smaller than a cup. Lasts until
ended.

=== Astral Reach \(1)
<astral-reach-1>
The Sorcerers of the Academy of Doors are most famous for this one
Spell. With it they may reach through any portal and into another known
receptacle. For example they might use it to reach through to a safe in
their manse via their purse. This Spell only allows partial
translocation— the wizard cannot fully or permanently enter.

=== Babble \(2)
<babble-2>
The wizard speaks nonsense while watching the intended target, causing
their words to trip and confuse. This may be done under their breath and
relatively subtly.

=== Banish Spirit \(6)
<banish-spirit-6>
The wizard explains, clearly, sternly, why it is impossible that the
spirit could be here at this time. The spirit must Test its Luck \(or
Skill for Enemies) or be sent to somewhere less improbable.

=== Befuddle \(1)
<befuddle-1>
A wizard’s touch can shake up someone’s mind like a snow globe. The
target makes all rolls at a -1 penalty until their head clears. Lasts
for 3 minutes.

=== Blood Shroud \(4)
<blood-shroud-4>
Smear a small amount of a demon’s blood on yourself to become completely
invisible to them, even if you attack or speak to them, for 6 hours.

=== Breach \(2)
<breach-2>
The wizard’s hands work elemental material as though it were soft clay.
Fire, stone, goo, earth, fog, all of it behaves like clay under their
touch. Lasts for 9 minutes.

=== Brittle Twigs \(2)
<brittle-twigs-2>
You snap a twig or other brittle object to cause an injury in another.
They must Test their Luck \(or Skill for Enemies) or suffer a broken
bone.

=== Callous Strike \(1)
<callous-strike-1>
The Wizard-Knights are most famous for their remote combat whereby they
swing their Silver Swords seemingly at nothing only for their opponents,
many metres away, to be torn to tatters. This Spell can be used in place
of a melee attack by Rolling Versus as normal and inflicting Damage
according to the Weapon used. May only be used against targets within
clear sight.

=== Coal Resolve \(1)
<coal-resolve-1>
This Spell turns one’s heart into a burning ember of grief. Those under
its effect are so consumed by grief that they are immune to mind
controlling effects and the non-physical impact of pain. Lasts until the
next rest.

=== Cockroach \(5)
<cockroach-5>
A popular Spell that turns troublesome folk into humiliated animals. The
target must Test their Luck \(or Skill for Enemies) or be turned into an
insignificant creature of the wizard’s choice. Lasts forever.

=== Cone of Air \(2)
<cone-of-air-2>
Creates a mysterious and specifically shaped cone of air focused on a
touched target’s head. They may continue to breathe the freshest of air
for 12 minutes.

=== Darkness \(3)
<darkness-3>
Summon a stationary, perfect sphere of darkness up to five metres from
the wizard for up to 3 minutes.

=== Darksee \(1)
<darksee-1>
The wizard reaches into their sockets and extricates their eyes. Thus
freed, the dark void behind can see perfectly well in pitch blackness
and suffer excruciating pain in light \(-4 penalty to all rolls). Be
careful not to lose those eyeballs as re-inserting them is the only way
to end the Spell.

=== Diminish \(2)
<diminish-2>
Cause something to Test its Luck \(or Skill for Enemies) or reduce its
size by half. Lasts 3 minutes.

=== Drown \(4)
<drown-4>
Cause a target’s lungs to fill with water. They must Test their Luck
\(or Skill for Enemies). If they fail they start to Drown \(7.9) and are
incapacitated as water pours from their mouth. They may Test again once
per Turn until they pass, at which point the Spell ends.

=== Earthquake \(5)
<earthquake-5>
The wizard hikes up their wizard robe and stomps their wizard feet. An
area 30 metres around them suffers a massive earthquake. Everyone must
Test their Luck \(or Skill for Enemies) or fall through a crack in the
earth, taking falling Damage and being stuck in a bloody great big hole
\(7.8.1). Buildings may be wrecked unless especially sturdy.

=== Ember \(2)
<ember-2>
A simple but effective summoning of fire. Flames the size of a small
bonfire appear somewhere within 12 metres of the wizard. Once present
there is no accounting for its actions. Exchange

=== Exchange Shape \(5)
<exchange-shape-5>
What looks like a hug is in fact fell wizardry! The wizard bumps into
another and exchanges bodies. Lasts until the wizard chooses to end it
but they must be within sight of their own body for this to happen.

=== Exorcism \(1)
<exorcism-1>
The Red Priests posit that all negative behaviour is a symptom of some
level of possession, or at least direct influence, by the forces of
Change, unwitting agents of Mass in need of healing. The wizard throws
salt at their target and Rolls Versus the possessing spirit to cast it
out. In the case of a Fumble the spirit is drawn into and possesses the
wizard.

=== Explode \(5)
<explode-5>
So simple that it’s arguably not even a Spell but rather a premeditated
failure of catastrophic proportions. The wizard causes a one cubic metre
object to explode and deal Damage to everyone within 24 metres depending
on proximity. Those within 6 metres take Damage as a Gigantic Beast,
within 12 as a Large Beast, 18 as a Modest Beast and 24 as a Small
Beast.

=== Farseeing \(2)
<farseeing-2>
Endows the wizard with engorged, plate-like eyes that are able to see in
minute detail for miles around but are unable to see anything up close.
Lasts until ended.

=== Fear \(1)
<fear-1>
In the eyes of one poor target the wizard grows into a primal monster
from the depths of their lizard brain. They will attempt to flee and if
flight is impossible they will curl up in a ball and whimper. They may
Test their Luck \(or Skill for Enemies) to resist the illusion.

=== Find \(2)
<find-2>
When wizards lose their glasses they mumble to themselves until they
turn up. The thing being sought must be a specific object, not a general
category or type, and the direction is only given in terms of compass
points.

=== Fire Bolt \(1)
<fire-bolt-1>
Shoot impressive flames from your fingertips, dealing Damage to one
target within 20 metres.

=== Flash \(3)
<flash-3>
The wizard claps neatly and issues forth the light of a thousand suns
from their hands. All within 20 metres must Test their Luck \(or Skill
for Enemies) or be blinded for 1d6 minutes.

=== Gills \(3)
<gills-3>
The wizard may permanently gift a touched subject with gills, replacing
their usual breathing arrangement if they fail to Test their Luck \(or
Skill for Enemies). Useful for underwater excursions but less so when
inflicted upon a chap in the middle of town. The wizard may end this at
will.

=== Grow \(2)
<grow-2>
Cause an item to grow half its size again if it fails to Test its Luck
\(or Skill for Enemies). Lasts for 3 minutes.

=== Helping Hands \(1)
<helping-hands-1>
Animate hands spring forth from an inanimate surface and perform any
task the wizard requires but are limited to being rooted to the spot
from which they sprang. They last until the wizard wills it or leaves
the location.

=== Hurricane \(5)
<hurricane-5>
The wizard waves their hands in the air like they just don’t care,
which, being wizards, they likely don’t. A mighty gust knocks everyone
over within 30 metres who fails to Test their Luck \(or Skill for
Enemies), dealing 1d3 Damage and making an awful mess. Lasts for 10
minutes. Test Luck every Turn if not taking cover or else take further
Damage.

=== Illusion \(2 per viewer)
<illusion-2-per-viewer>
Those viewing this illusion may Test their Luck \(or Skill for Enemies)
to unveil the trickery. Lasts until the wizard leaves or falls asleep.

=== Invisibility \(3)
<invisibility-3>
The wizard turns flesh into refractive crystal sheets. It’s very
uncomfortable and you make a slight shish-ing sound as you move but are
quite invisible and don’t suffer from the usual limitations of
illusions. Lasts for 3 minutes after which you noisily reform into dull
and frustratingly opaque flesh.

=== Ironhand \(3)
<ironhand-3>
The common man does not appreciate exactly how close flesh and iron are
when considered relative to, say, flesh and the smell of hot tea. With
some slight convincing the wizard may cause a target’s flesh to behave
as though it had the desirable properties of metal. They get +1 Skill
and immunity to modestly proportioned fires for 3 minutes.

=== Jolt \(1)
<jolt-1>
The mischievous apprentice’s favourite Spell, Jolt sends an arc of
electricity from the wizard’s outstretched hand towards a target.
Ignores Armour.

=== Languages \(1)
<languages-1>
The wizard forms a mouth with their hands through which they can speak
any language. They can simultaneously cup their other hand to their ear
to understand them in return. Lasts for one conversation.

=== Leech \(2)
<leech-2>
The necromancer must place their hands on a living subject and allow
their fingertips to transform into sucking apertures which drain the
victim of blood. Deal 2d6 Damage to your victim and regain half as much
Stamina.

=== Levitate \(2)
<levitate-2>
Elevates the wizard or another on the backs of tiny invisible sprites
who answer only to their summoner. May float about for 3 minutes.

=== Life Line \(1)
<life-line-1>
Created by the Horizon Knights to enable them to take the fight to the
Nothing, they would cast this on their squires and dive off the edge of
creation. While this Spell lasts the wizard’s essential bodily functions
are linked to another, thereby enabling them to breath or eat for the
recipient. They will need to breathe and eat for two, which makes it
hard to do anything useful while linked. The Spell lasts for a day,
until cancelled, or until the death of the linked person. Note if the
linked person dies, starves, or is choked you will suffer equally.

=== Light \(1)
<light-1>
Create an ethereal orb of light that glows like a torch. Lasts 6 hours
and can be extinguished at will.

=== Lock \(1)
<lock-1>
Magically lock an object. The object must have a lockable aspect to it
but is now magically sealed. Permanent until undone or dismissed.

=== Mirror Selves \(3)
<mirror-selves-3>
In the minds of others the wizard appears to be, in fact, three wizards.
All three will perform the same actions in unison, offering attackers
only a 1 in 3 chance of targeting the right wizard. Lasts for 12
minutes.

=== Natter \(1)
<natter-1>
As everyone knows, wizards are excellent ventriloquists, so good, in
fact, that they can throw their voice inside another’s mouth. They can
target anyone within sight and transmit a short sentence.

=== Open \(1)
<open-1>
The wizard chooses a reality wherein the lock was open all along. May be
used to open any mundane door or container and counteract a Lock Spell.

=== Peace \(2)
<peace-2>
Open up the mind to universal love and cause two subjects to Test their
Luck \(or Skill for Enemies) or cease hostilities. They will still
defend themselves if attacked but will at least appreciate the pettiness
of it.

=== Poison \(1)
<poison-1>
When cast upon a liquid this Spell causes it to become deadly poison.
The liquid deals 4 Damage if drunk and 1 Damage per Turn until the
target successfully Tests their Luck \(or Skill for Enemies). The liquid
loses its potency after an hour.

=== Posthumous Vitality \(5)
<posthumous-vitality-5>
Necromancers, known for their social inadequacy, often find themselves
having to make friends. This Spell requires a fresh, or at least whole
and lubricated, corpse. The wizard rolls 2d6 plus their Posthumous
Vitality Skill Total and consults the following chart \(13+ counts for
an Advancement tick): 4-12 Nothing happens. 13-14 The vitality is
clumsily applied, causing the body to explode messily. A new one will
need to be found. 15-16 The creature is animated and will last for 24
hours before literally falling to pieces. 17+ Perfect reanimation. The
creature will last until destroyed.

=== Presence \(1)
<presence-1>
This Spell creates the sense of being watched by a patriarchal figure.
Some find it comforting, others, not so much.

=== Protection from Rain \(1)
<protection-from-rain-1>
This Spell prevents the wizard from getting rained upon for one shower.

=== Purple Lens \(1)
<purple-lens-1>
The recipient’s eyes glow purple as they experience an alternative
reality where people are kind, their surroundings are beautiful, their
food is indulgent, and so on. This doesn’t change the reality of things
but it does make them more palatable. Lasts until they want it to end.

=== Quench \(1)
<quench-1>
Snuff a small flame with the wave of a hand.

=== Read Entrails \(1)
<read-entrails-1>
The wizard can get the answer to one question from the entrails of a
living creature. The size and importance of the creature influences the
level of knowledge gained. Small, common animals are able to offer yes
or no answers, oxen can predict things obtusely, lamassu may offer
explicit and thorough advice.

=== Read Stars \(1)
<read-stars-1>
Rather than physical stars the wizard navigates by astral starlight that
peeks through the veil. This Spell enables the wizard to get a
reasonable sense of direction regardless of any obscuring factors.

=== See Through \(1)
<see-through-1>
The wizard rubs a surface vigorously, making it translucent. Can
penetrate up to 12 inches of material. Lead and Silver are immune.

=== Sentry \(1)
<sentry-1>
The wizard plucks a bit of their mind out like candy floss and leaves it
stuck to a wall somewhere. This psychic presence is invisible to the
naked eye but extends the wizard’s senses to that spot for the duration.
While it lasts the wizard suffers -1 to all rolls due to the incredible
confusion this generates. If the shard is discovered and harmed the
wizard will lose 2d6 Stamina due to the shock.

=== Shatter \(3)
<shatter-3>
The wizard may wildly gesticulate at a brittle object no larger than an
umbrella and cause it to shatter into a million pieces. Living targets
may Test their Luck to avoid this unpleasant Spell.

=== Skeletal Counsel \(3)
<skeletal-counsel-3>
Necromancers often talk to skulls. Sometimes they talk back. Use of this
Spell enables speaking with the dead, who answer one question per
casting. Requires a skull.

=== Sleep \(2)
<sleep-2>
The wizard convinces a target to forgo wakefulness for a time, causing
them to sleep until woken unless they successfully Test their Luck.
Remember: fighting is loud.

=== Slide Skywards \(6)
<slide-skywards-6>
Requires mirrors or other highly reflective surfaces. The wizard stands
between two reflective surfaces so that they are infinitely repeated.
They then step out from between them but as a different incidence of
themselves. To those watching the wizard moves in the direction not seen
and reappears between two mirrors elsewhere. If the location has been
compromised the wizard arrives in a random mirrored location somewhere
across the million crystal spheres.

=== Starry Orb \(4)
<starry-orb-4>
The wizard creates a 5th dimensional orb above their head. All
intelligent beings looking at it must Test their Luck or marvel at it
for 3 minutes.

=== Teleport \(10)
<teleport-10>
The wizard or a target of their choosing may travel to any location
within a single sphere instantly. If unfamiliar with the location they
must Test their Luck \(or Skill for Enemies) or be thrown wildly off
course to potentially devastating results.

=== Thought Vapour \(1)
<thought-vapour-1>
The wizard can cause their nose to exist in multiple alternative
realities, travel through various spheres, and enable the olfactory
sensation of thought. Emotions, attitudes, and underlying feelings can
be smelled. No words or images are formed, just impressions. Any strong
odour will cause this Spell to fail.

=== Thunder \(2)
<thunder-2>
The wizard raises their arms and shouts something suitably ominous. All
within 24 metres must Test their Luck \(or Skill for Enemies) or be
deafened by a riotous roll of thunder. Luck or no, they will be mightily
impressed.

=== Tongue Twister \(2)
<tongue-twister-2>
Beware! If a wizard screws their nose and twists their fingers at you
then a Tongue Twister is coming your way. The target must Test their
Luck \(or Skill for Enemies) or have their tongue literally tied in
knots. This requires some time and a fair bit of patience to
disentangle.

=== Torpor \(3)
<torpor-3>
Those who study the dead consider it necessary to develop a profound
sympathy with their subject — how can you speak with the dead if you
don’t understand the dead? Torpor helps build post-mortem empathy by
causing the necromancer to temporarily die. Bodily functions are halted,
no food, water, or air is needed, and they are, by most vulgar
definitions of the word, dead. The Spell lasts until ended by the
wizard, who remains vaguely aware of their surroundings to the extent of
being conscious of sound and movement but not of what is said or who is
saying it. They will still take Damage from bodily abuse while under the
effect and can indeed become irretrievably dead.

=== True Seeing \(3)
<true-seeing-3>
The wizard focuses their sight on the unambiguous truth of matter,
enabling them to see through illusions for the next 10 minutes.

\#\#\# Undo \(double cost of original Spell) The wizard disentangles a
Spell from this instance of reality. To do so they must Roll Versus the
original casting if disentanglement is possible at all.

=== Ward \(1)
<ward-1>
A handy Spell only requiring the flick of a wrist. In response to being
fired upon the wizard may cast this Spell to cause the missile to be
deflected.

=== Wall of Power \(2)
<wall-of-power-2>
What they call a wall is in fact a dome, but wizards always have worked
in mysterious ways. The wall is a shimmering bubble that causes 1d6
Damage when touched. Nothing may pass without the wizard’s permission
\(it is recommended that they remember to allow air). Lasts for 12
minutes.

=== Web \(2)
<web-2>
Whether this is opening a portal to the plane of slime or channelling
the sprites of sickness, all can agree that it is quite disgusting. The
wizard blows forth the "web" from their nose and all in a cone extending
12 metres in front of the wizard are trapped unless they Test their Luck
\(or Skill for Enemies). Each Turn anything passing through or out of it
must repeat the Test or become stuck. Dries up after 12 rounds.

=== Zed \(?)
<zed>
No one knows what this does but everyone who has cast it disappears
instantly, never to be seen again.
