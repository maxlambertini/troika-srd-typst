== Rolling the Dice
<rolling-the-dice>
There is only one die type used in Troika!, that being the d6. This can
be used as a d3, d6, d66, d666, and so on. To roll a d3 just roll a d6
and halve it, rounding up. To roll a d66, d666, or more just roll a d6
as many times, in order, as there are 6s. So a d66 would be a d6
followed by another d6 \(e.g.~I roll a 1 then roll a 4 thus making a
roll of 14). To do most actions you’ll be required to roll 2d6, adding
them together, as a Roll Under or a Roll Versus.

=== Roll Under
<roll-under>
Rolling Under is the throwing of 2d6 with the intention of scoring equal
to or under a number. This will mainly be used in unopposed situations
like climbing a wall or casting a Spell. Rolling two 6s always results
in failure.

=== Roll Versus
<roll-versus>
Roll Versus, mostly used for combat or other contests, occurs when two
opponents each roll 2d6 and add any applicable bonuses, then compare
results, the higher total winning. In a duel you might be rolling 2d6
and adding your Sword Fighting total, looking to beat your opponent who
is doing similar.

== Advanced Skills & Spells
<advanced-skills-spells>
Characters have a variety of Advanced Skills & Spells granted them by
their Background. The number given in the Background plus their Skill is
referred to as their Skill Total. Write this on the character sheet. 2.1
Testing Advanced Skills & Spells Most Tests of Advanced Skills & Spells
are Roll Under \(12 & 14).

- When you successfully Test an Advanced Skill or Spell, put a tick next
  to it on your character sheet. These are used to Get Better \(11.1).

== Luck
<luck>
Of all the numbers on your character sheet Luck is likely to fluctuate
the most. This number represents your character’s fortune and intuition,
tested whenever fate swipes at them. When this happens the GM will ask
you to Test your Luck or suffer the consequences.

=== Testing your Luck
<testing-your-luck>
Roll equal to or less than your current Luck score. Every time you Test
your Luck, reduce your current Luck score by 1 regardless of whether the
Test was successful or not. Testing your Luck is optional; you may
always refuse to roll and instead accept your fate. The GM is not
obliged to give you details of the consequences if they are not already
obvious.

=== Gaining and Losing Luck
<gaining-and-losing-luck>
For every 8 hours rest you may regain 2d6 Luck. Luck may not exceed the
starting value rolled at character creation save for exceptional
situations. Running out of Luck inflicts no special penalty.

=== Use of Luck in Combat
<use-of-luck-in-combat>
In the case of a tie the character may Test their Luck to break it in
their favour. When a character successfully hits an opponent, but before
rolling for Damage, they may decide to Test their Luck and, if
successful, may add 2 to their Damage Roll.

=== OPTIONAL: Luck Versus Death
<optional-luck-versus-death>
If you find your games are too fatal and that the turnover of characters
is too much to bear the GM might optionally allow characters who have
died to Test their Luck and, instead of dying, be incapacitated,
wounded, or saved by some bizarre twist of fate.

== Stamina
<stamina>
=== Running Out of Stamina
<running-out-of-stamina>
When reduced to 0 Stamina you are in danger of dying and must be healed
in order to survive. If this is during an Initiative Round the next time
the End of the Round Token is drawn you die. If this happens out of
Initiative your friends have one opportunity to Heal you \(restoring you
to 1 Stamina) or else you are dead.

=== Healing
<healing>
You regain 2d6 Stamina if you sleep for 8 hours. You may also eat a
Provision to regain 1d6 Stamina. A maximum of 3 Provisions per day will
provide healing benefits. There may be other forms of healing available
at your GM’s discretion such as visiting bath houses or drinking
potions. You may never have more Stamina than your starting total.

=== Negative Stamina
<negative-stamina>
If you ever go below 0 Stamina you are dead.

=== Death
<death>
You may immediately make a new character while others mourn your loss
and fight over your possessions. This new character starts exactly
according to the rules found at the beginning of this book.

== Initiative
<initiative>
=== Assemble the Stack
<assemble-the-stack>
During combat or at other times where it is important to know who goes
first you will need to assemble the Initiative Stack. To do this get a
container and a selection of coloured dice or other convenient markers
\(consider cards, poker chips, and so on).

+ Assign each character 2 Tokens of a single color.
+ Add Tokens to the Stack for the enemies equal to their total combined
  Initiative \(if you have 8 Lizard-Men \(Initiative 2) you would add 16
  tokens to the Stack).
+ Add 1 Token of a distinct colour to the Stack. This Token signifies
  the End of the Round.
+ OPTIONAL: Enemy Initiative Limit. It is very likely that sometimes the
  characters’ enemies will grossly outnumber them and make it very hard
  for them to act. The GM may optionally limit the number of Enemy
  Initiative Tokens placed in the Stack to double that which the
  characters contribute. So if a party of 5 \(10 Initiative Tokens in
  total) is attacked by fifty goblins \(50 Initiative Tokens) the
  goblins will only contribute 20 Tokens to the Stack. Bear in mind that
  the GM should feel free to balance Initiative Stacks as it seems
  appropriate.

=== Using the Stack
<using-the-stack>
The GM will remove a Token from the Stack at random, the colour or
design of which will determine who holds the Initiative and takes a
Turn. Consider giving a copy of their Token to each player so that
everyone remembers which colour or design is theirs.

=== End of the Round
<end-of-the-round>
If the End of the Round Token is drawn all Tokens, including the End of
the Round Token, are put back in the Stack. Remove Tokens contributed by
dead characters and enemies, resolve any per Round or end of Round
activities such as magic effects, Drowning \(7.9), fire, poison, or
bleeding, then draw another Token and carry on.

=== Henchmen
<henchmen>
Hired help that are willing to engage in combat each provide 1
Initiative Token to the Stack. Henchmen share a single colour Token and
when a henchman Token is drawn the GM determines who acts and what they
do. The GM should take the wishes of the players under advisement but
act in the best interests of the henchman.

=== Enemies
<enemies>
All enemies contribute a varying number of Initiative Tokens to the
Initiative Stack according to their combined Initiative and share the
same colour or design. When drawing an enemy Initiative Token the GM can
declare that any enemy is acting, including an enemy who has acted
previously this Round. Obviously this can be abused for mechanical gain
on the GM’s part though that would be entirely to the detriment of the
game and is discouraged. Apply Initiative Tokens as they make sense.

=== Rationale
<rationale>
The random Turn length adds a degree of uncertainty where you never know
how much time you have left. When actions are not taking place it
represents hesitation, panic, or other incidental delays that can happen
in a tense encounter where every second counts. The goblins have few
Tokens because they are cowardly, not because they are slow; the dragon
has many because it knows exactly what it wants, not because it is fast.

== Actions
<actions>
When you hold the Initiative you may take a Turn and can generally
perform one action. The following list is not exhaustive and the GM is
encouraged to interpret player intentions as best they can.

=== Hit Someone
<hit-someone>
To stab, bludgeon, or otherwise physically interfere with someone, Roll
\(2d6+Skill+Advanced Skill) Versus an opponent doing the same thing. The
winner Rolls for Damage and the loser deducts the number generated by
the Damage Roll from their Stamina. Note that either party in any
exchange can potentially win. In a tie both parties have avoided hurting
each other. Also note that this means you can potentially hit an
unlimited number of people in a Round but may only Initiate once per
Turn.

=== Shoot Someone
<shoot-someone>
Shooting an opponent is resolved by Rolling Versus their Skill or
appropriate evasive Advanced Skill such as Shield or Dodge.

==== Shooting Into Melee.
<shooting-into-melee.>
When shooting into melee on a successful hit assign a number to every
individual involved and roll a die. If their number comes up they
receive the Damage.

==== Aim
<aim>
On your Turn you may decide to take Aim with your ranged Weapon. To do
so hold onto your Initiative Token. When your next Initiative Token is
drawn you may roll twice and pick the best roll. If the End of the Round
Token comes up and you haven’t used your Aim Token you may decide to
hold onto it for the next Round.

=== Cast a Spell
<cast-a-spell>
Each Spell has its own instructions on how it should be used but in
general you will need to spend a certain amount of Stamina and Roll
Under or Roll Versus \(for Spells that require you to touch an unwilling
party, for instance) in order to create some kind of effect. Unless the
Spell says otherwise it requires at least one hand free and the ability
to speak. Roll on the Oops! Table if the result is a Fumble.

=== Delay
<delay>
You may choose not to act when you hold Initiative. In that case put
your Token back in the Stack.

=== Move
<move>
Every action is assumed to have a bit of movement involved. Anything
less than 12 metres is folded into whatever else you might be doing. If
you wish to chase after someone or perform some other involved
locomotion then just spend a Turn doing it.

=== Retrieve an Item
<retrieve-an-item>
If you need to get something out that you weren’t already holding in
your hands roll 2d6 and score equal to or higher than its position on
your Inventory list. If you succeed you can pull it out and do what you
intended. Otherwise you spend your entire action finding it. Double 1s
always indicate a failure. Retrieving an arrow counts as an item
retrieval. Make sure they’re packed on top! See Sections 10.3 and 10.4.1
for more on Inventories.

=== Use an Item
<use-an-item>
If an item is in your hands you may use it however you like \(6.6).

=== Grapple
<grapple>
Roll Versus your opponent’s Wrestling Skill. If you win you may either
knock them to the ground or deal Damage as Unarmed and knock you both to
the ground \(from throwing or tackling them). On a Mighty Blow \(7.4)
you render them unconscious for 1d6 Rounds. If you fail to grapple them
they may deal Damage to you as though they had attacked you normally
whereas if you Fumble \(7.5) they deal you a Mighty Blow.

== Other Concerns
<other-concerns>
=== Cover
<cover>
When attacking someone in cover they receive a bonus to their roll to
not be hit. Consider a waist high bush to be +1 while a castle’s
crenulations would be +6.

=== Enemies
<enemies-1>
Mechanically speaking, an opponent is typically reduced to three
numbers: Skill, Stamina, and Initiative. Beyond this they may have an
Advanced Skill or two or some peculiar special rules.

=== Hitting Someone Unawares
<hitting-someone-unawares>
If your opponent is not aware of your presence your attack is a Roll
Under rather than a Roll Versus \(1.2), they may not attack back, and
you may add 2 to your Damage Roll.

=== Mighty Blows
<mighty-blows>
If you roll a double 6 while attacking you strike a Mighty Blow, win the
exchange, and inflict Double Damage \(8.1). If both parties strike a
Mighty Blow a spectacular clinch is formed, shattering both Weapons \(in
the case of beastly claws, tentacles, and so on they will lose 1d6
Stamina instead).

=== Fumbles
<fumbles>
A roll of double 1s in combat results in the roller losing the exchange
and their opponent adding 1 to their Damage Roll. If both parties Fumble
they each deal Damage to the other, adding 1 to their Damage Roll.

=== Shields
<shields>
Shields reduce Damage Rolls by 1 to a minimum of 1.

=== Use of Multiple Weapons
<use-of-multiple-weapons>
When rolling Damage you may choose which Weapon to reference the Damage
Roll against after rolling. You must be holding it in your hands or
nearest approximations, obviously.

=== Falling Over
<falling-over>
When on the floor you suffer -2 to all physical rolls against those
standing, including Damage Rolls, and must spend a Turn getting to your
feet.

==== Falling Too Far.
<falling-too-far.>
When engaging in uncontrolled falls you lose 1d6 Stamina per 2 metres
fallen when you land.

=== Drowning
<drowning>
When you fail a Swimming Test you begin to Drown and lose 1d6 Stamina.
For each consecutive Swimming Test where you make no progress you roll
an additional 1d6. So for instance your third failed Swimming roll in a
row would lose you 3d6 Stamina. Once you lose all Stamina you have
Drowned.

==== Fire, Poison, and Bleeding.
<fire-poison-and-bleeding.>
Any ongoing debilitating effects should be treated similarly to
Drowning. Unless you have a specific effect in mind have the victim lose
1d6 Stamina per Turn with it optionally becoming more severe unless they
either pass a related Advanced Skill Test or successfully Test their
Luck \(or Skill for Enemies). Improvisation is strongly encouraged.

==== Degenerative Effects in Combat.
<degenerative-effects-in-combat.>
Test for Drowning, fire, etc. only when the End of the Round Token is
drawn.

=== Henchmen
<henchmen-1>
Henchmen are created as you would a monster, with truncated abilities
only covering their essence. They are their own people with their own
motivations and are not just pieces of equipment. It is up to the GM and
players to flesh them out or not as the case may be. Also see Section
5.4.

=== Time
<time>
There are two main units of time in the game: Turns and Rounds. A Turn
is what someone does when they hold Initiative and is a few seconds
long. A Round is the period between drawing successive End of the Round
Tokens and is roughly equal to one minute.

== Damage
<damage>
When you win a Roll Versus an opponent in combat you inflict Damage.
After successfully hitting someone roll d6 and consult the Damage Charts
on the inside front cover of this book. Reference your Damage Roll
across the top row and the Weapon down the side. The result is the
Damage inflicted and is deducted from your opponent’s Stamina.

=== Double Damage
<double-damage>
When striking a Mighty Blow \(7.4) you double the amount of Stamina lost
as a result of a Damage Roll.

=== Damage Modifiers
<damage-modifiers>
All modifiers that add bonuses to Damage will, unless otherwise
specified, modify the roll of the die, not the actual Damage inflicted.
So, for instance, I have +1 to my Damage Roll and roll a 5 on the Sword
entry. Due to my bonus I am counted as having rolled a 6 and inflict 8
Damage instead of 6.

=== Unusual Weapons
<unusual-weapons>
It is entirely acceptable to use existing Weapons to provide the Damage
matrix of roughly equivalent Exotic Weapons, such as counting a Rapier
as a Sword for Damage purposes. This does not preclude the possibility
of making specific matrices for your inventions.

== Armour
<armour>
Armour offers a certain degree of protection to your soft and supple
body. There are four levels of protection, vaguely defined, allowing you
to assign whatever assortment of pots and pans you might be wearing to
an appropriate level without too much bother. A target is considered to
be Unarmoured, Lightly Armoured, Modestly Armoured, or Heavily Armoured.
Each modifies Damage Rolls by 0, -1, -2 and -3 respectively, to a
minimum of 1.

=== Armour Encumbrance
<armour-encumbrance>
Armour takes up a number of item slots equal to twice its protective
value. So Heavy Armour would use six slots, for example. See Section
10.2

== Encumbrance
<encumbrance>
You may carry twelve things without issue. On your character sheet you
will have twelve spaces to write in the things you’re lugging around
with you.

=== Small Items
<small-items>
Some items are of inconsequential individual weight, like arrows, and
will only ever take up one slot unless you have an awful lot of them.
What constitutes a lot is up to your group to decide.

=== Large Items
<large-items>
Large items are anything you need both hands to hold. They take up two
slots in your inventory \(we recommend writing them at a jaunty angle to
fill up the space). Armour has its own rules.

=== Retrieving Items in a Hurry
<retrieving-items-in-a-hurry>
See Section 6.6. Note that having things near the top of your Inventory
list is advantageous, so put things you’ll rarely need in a hurry, like
Armour and money, near the bottom. Pack your bags well!

=== Overburdened
<overburdened>
If you find yourself carrying more than 12 items you suffer -4 to all
rolls due to the inconvenient weight. If you are carrying 18 items or
more you suffer -4 to all rolls, you can hardly move, and you count as
Unawares \(7.3) for anyone wanting to stab you.

==== Dropping Things in a Hurry.
<dropping-things-in-a-hurry.>
If you want to unburden yourself quickly roll 1d6. The result is how
many slots of things you may carefully put down this Turn. At the GM’s
discretion you may roll 2d6 if you don’t mind them getting broken or
lost.

== Getting Better
<getting-better>
Life is learning and you cannot experience it without growing in some
way. Your characters will bend and change in response to their
environment. When you successfully use a Skill you stand to learn from
it. Put a tick next to it on your character sheet.

=== How to Advance
<how-to-advance>
The next time you have a chance to rest and reflect on your journey you
may check to see what you have learned. Choose up to 3 Advanced Skills
or Spells with a tick next to them. If you roll 2d6 over your current
Skill Total \(Advanced Skill/Spell + Skill) you may increase it by 1.
When you have finished rolling, remove all ticks from your sheet.

==== 12+ Advanced Skill.
<advanced-skill.>
When an Advanced Skill has reached 12 you need to roll a 12 followed by
another 12 to improve it further. There is no upper limit to an Advanced
Skill.

=== Training and Learning New Advanced Skills
<training-and-learning-new-advanced-skills>
It is also possible to improve your Advanced Skills or to learn new
ones, though you must find someone who is willing to teach you. They
must have a higher Skill plus Advanced Skill than you and will most
likely require payment unless they are your fellow party member or
already owe you a favour. Training takes 1 week plus 1 week per rank you
already have in the Advanced Skill you are looking to improve. At the
end of this time you get one chance at advancement. Failure means you
just have to train harder. When learning new Advanced Skills you must
Roll Under your Skill on 2d6 \(precocious students are easier to teach)
to gain your first point.

== Advanced Skill Descriptions
<advanced-skill-descriptions>
In most cases the use of a Skill will be a straight Roll Under the Skill
Total \(Skill plus Advanced Skill). Situations where this isn’t the case
should be obvious. The available Skills are not limited to those listed
here. There should be rarer fare available for those who search for it
or maybe a character just feels driven to learn the intricacies of
farming or opera for some peculiar reason. You may notice some Skills in
the Backgrounds section that don’t have entries. Make those up. Since
the players don’t ever have to waste time picking through the whole
selection don’t be afraid of expanding the list and making them more and
more specific.

=== Acrobatics
<acrobatics>
Used for rolling, balancing, falling, jumping, etc.

=== Astrology
<astrology>
An essential Skill for anyone intent on travelling the stars. Can be
used to identify stars and constellations, to gather hints on the
destination of interdimensional portals, and to make star charts.

=== Awareness
<awareness>
Anything worth having is well hidden so one must look very carefully.
Use this to spot traps, things normally hidden, or things out of the
ordinary.

=== Climb
<climb>
The usefulness of the ability to clamber up things cannot be overstated.
Most climbs should be single rolls though longer or more difficult
climbs may require multiple rolls. On these climbs consider requiring a
number or total or repeated failures to fall off unless it is a
particularly merciless ascent. The GM should use their discretion.

=== Crafting Skills
<crafting-skills>
This includes any Skill you might think of that comes under the heading
of arts and crafts. Blacksmithing, carpentry, painting, opera singing,
anything like that. Roll Under the Skill if you want to do something
that knowledge of this Skill would reasonably cover. A carpenter might
be able to spot a weak bridge while a blacksmith could shoe a horse or
an opera singer could identify an aria. Be flexible and reasonable.

=== Disguise
<disguise>
Covers the use of props to change your appearance. When in disguise you
must Roll Under this when someone is liable to see through it. Opposed
by Awareness when under scrutiny.

=== Etiquette
<etiquette>
When making a good impression is important Roll Versus your host’s
Etiquette. Represents a mechanical understanding of social conduct and
those who are better at it are more discerning.

=== Evaluate
<evaluate>
Test this to get an idea of how much something is worth.

=== Fly
<fly>
Use Fly much as you would Run. In normal situations this doesn’t need
testing, only in chases or high winds, maybe. Anyone attempting to Fly
without this Skill must Test every Round to make sure they don’t crash
or lose control.

=== Golden Barge Pilot
<golden-barge-pilot>
Test this to navigate between the stars on a ship with golden mirror
sails.

=== Healing
<healing-1>
Used to stitch wounds and apply ointments, stop bleeding, slow poison
and the like. Also used for stabilising dying people.

=== Languages
<languages>
Represents relative competence in specific languages and would only need
to be Tested if trying to understand something incredibly arcane or
technical. It’s assumed that once you have one point in a language you
can understand it passably. You get one tick in a language for every
month of intense tuition or complete submersion in it.

=== Locks
<locks>
This allows a character to examine and open locks but does not detect
traps. Roll Versus an imaginary locksmith whose Skill is somewhere
between 6 and 12 with 6 being easy and 12 being very hard.

=== Mathmology
<mathmology>
Use this to gain insight into angles, pressures, numbers, and other such
arcane arts. You could, for instance, Test your Mathmology to get a good
idea of the surface tension of a ball of inert plasmic goo or to find
the fulcrum for tripping a giant.

=== Poison
<poison>
You may Test this Skill during down time to create a single dose of
poison. Pick which kind it is when you make it. This list is not
exhaustive — more exotic ones may be available if you possess the
knowledge and ingredients. 1d3 Common Poisons of Troika: 1 Causes anyone
ingesting it to Test their Luck \(or Skill for Enemies) or lose 4d6
Stamina. 2 Add 1 to all Damage Rolls while this is applied to piercing
or edged Weapons. If you Roll a 1 for Damage the poison has worn off. 3
Causes anyone ingesting it to fall unconscious for 1d6 hours.

=== Ride
<ride>
Everyone is assumed to have basic animal riding Skill though anything
more than trotting slowly will require some kind of roll to avoid
trouble.

=== Run
<run>
When it matters how fast you are, or if you can reach somewhere in time,
use this. A basic chase is an Roll Versus.

=== Second Sight
<second-sight>
Use of this allows the detection of magic. On a successful Test you
focus your inner eye and all sorcerous activity glows faintly for a
moment.

=== Secret Signs
<secret-signs>
Used to identify marks, handshakes, code words, etc. of one specific
society. You would, for example, be able to read the secret marks left
on people’s door posts by fellow hobos.

=== Sleight of Hand
<sleight-of-hand>
Steal or hide small things. This is Tested only if someone is actively
looking for them. A character may simply declare they are hiding
something, only rolling this when the hiddenness is questioned.

=== Sneak
<sneak>
The art of remaining unseen. This is Tested only when someone or
something is actively trying to detect you. The sneaker would Roll
Versus the Awareness of those searching for them; anyone beating the
sneaker’s score detects them.

=== Strength
<strength>
Used for lifting and breaking things. May also be used to grapple people
if no grappling-appropriate Weapon Skill is possessed, though it counts
for half rounded up.

=== Swim
<swim>
Use this while swimming in dangerous waters, diving, holding your breath
for long periods, and so on. If you have this Skill you don’t need to
roll it for normal cWonditions. Characters without it are assumed to not
be able to swim and need to test Swimming every round they remain in the
water or start Drowning \(7.9). Receive a penalty to this Skill equal to
half the number of item slots filled.

=== Tracking
<tracking>
Used to stalk prey and find tracks. When stalking a quarry this is
treated as an opposed Roll Versus the opponent’s Tracking or Sneaking.

=== Trapping
<trapping>
Use this to set and disarm traps. When setting traps Roll Under your
Trapping Skill and describe how the trap is made with the materials at
hand. When someone wishes to disarm a trap they must Roll Versus the
original trap-setter’s Trapping Skill. If the GM doesn’t know what that
number should be assume 6 to be pretty simple while 12 is incredibly
hard. Scale it between those as appropriate.

=== Tunnel Fighting
<tunnel-fighting>
You may use this Skill in place of your Weapon Skill while fighting in
confined spaces where you would otherwise be unable to swing your Weapon
about. You ignore all penalties the GM might associate with fighting in
such a situation.

=== Weapon Fighting
<weapon-fighting>
Choose what general category of Weapons this covers when you take this
Skill. Roll Versus during combat when using the appropriate method of
assault. The GM is encouraged to allow Weapon categories to be broadly
applicable, such as Glaive Fighting being equivalent to Polearm
Fighting.

=== Other
<other>
If a Skill isn’t listed here then make it up. Anything can be a Skill,
from Jousting to Gambling to Eating. Skills are primarily used as
flavour and the occasional fun instance where your incredibly specific
and heretofore useless ability helps you and your friends out is
priceless.
